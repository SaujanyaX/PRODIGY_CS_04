# PRODIGY_CS_04
This is one of my internship tasks at Prodigy InfoTech. 
The following code is a simple keylogger program written in Python using the `pynput` library. 
It prompts the user to specify a duration for recording keystrokes. 
After the set time, the recorded keystrokes are stored in a file named `keylog.txt`, which can be accessed later. 
The `pynput` library must be installed beforehand to execute this script. 
Running this program may require administrator or superuser privileges. 
I tested it on my Kali Linux terminal within a virtual machine, where I had to operate as a superuser.
